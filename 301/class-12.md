## EJS Partials
- EJS Partials can be used for using the same HTML and CSS template for areas of your site that don't change by the page, things like navs and footer often are partials.
- These can be inserted into a different file by using <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %> where partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
