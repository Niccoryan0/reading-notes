## Templating with Mustache
Mustache is a logic-less template syntax, meaning there are no if statements in it, elses or for loops, only tags, some are replaced wqith a value, a series of values or nothing. Mustache is not a templating engine, it is a specification for a templating language, meaning we write templates with Mustache syntax and then compile it in a templating engine to be rendered.
