# Day 15 Readings

## Silicon Valleyâ€™s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago
- The article discusses the underlying reasons that 70% of employees at big tech companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are male, with a very small number of female workers at these large companies.
- The article links this to the marketing for video games in the 80s, a time when a sharp drop off of women in technology was seen, and those games were marketed at boys and men primarily. A study from 1985 showed that 735 of men used a computer weekly while only 45% of women did. 
- This targeted marketing and the result led to an experience gap, shown at places like Carnegie Melon where in 1995 40% of male respondents to a survery passed an AP CS Exam to skip intro classes, while none of their first year female contemporaries did. 
- On top of finding it harder to get in, women tend to stay in the industry for less time, one study found that US women were 45% more likely to leave careers in tech than men.

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies
- I'm pretty impressed with IndieGogo for that 50/50 ratio, it's sad to see some of the largest companies performing the worst in these diversity areas, although it seems like things are improving generally, at least compared to that previous article which painted a more dismal picture.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company
- Studies have shown that diverse work environments significantly benefit when approaching creative or innovation-based tasks or projects.
- Diverse companies have also been shown to perform better, studies have sown that female representation at high levels in companies can lead to an increase in firm value, and that at least for banks, racial diversity was tied to better financial performance.
- Companies also pass up on fantastic employees if they fall prey to their own biases, and many companies have pushed for a meritocracy centered system that is devoid of biases and prejudice.
- User bases will always be diverse, and the more diverse the team creating the product is the most inclusive it can be of that diversity, widening product appeal.
