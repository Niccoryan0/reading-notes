It discusses the fact that researchers found a few qualities from groups who put out quality work in a study finding the good groups all talked about an equal amount, they also were generally skilled at intuiting the thoughts and feelings of those around them, making them more sympathetic to their group mates, the article then makes the conclusion that if given the choice between a serious-minded team and a more free-flowing cooperative group the latter is a better choice.
