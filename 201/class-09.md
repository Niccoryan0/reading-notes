# Day 09 Readings
*Readings for day 9 of class*

## HTML&CSS book:
### Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)
Users will fill in forms and then pressa button to submit the information from the form to the server, the server stores and processes this information with a programming language and then creates a new page to send back to the browser. Forms are the main method to collect information from a user. Forms are given name/value pairs. Each form control also has aname and the text the user types in or the value they select are sent to the server.

### Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)
There are many available CSS properties for changing the appearance of things like lists, tables and forms, in addition to all the normal CSS properties which can also be applied to these things. List-style-type and list-style images can change the appearance of list markers. Table cells can be resized and spaced, and be made as consistent or variable as you want. Forms are also generally easier used if the controls are vertically aligned, and they benefit from feeling more interactive in their style.

## JS/JQuery Book:
### Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)
Events occur when a user interacts with the HTML on a web page and this triggers some JavaScript code. The steps are: select the element node(s) needed, indicate the event that will occur, and state the code you want to run when it does. Because HTML elements nest inside eachother, each event has a "flow" which starts at the directly indicated element, such as an a tag in a list item in an unordereded list, in "Event Bubbling" wherein an event starts at the MOST specific node then "flows" all the way out, layer by layer, to encompass the entire document. Alternatively "Event Capturing" is essentially the opposite, starting at least specific and flowing in to the most specific node. This flow matter when multiple elements in this parent/child relationship have event handlers.
