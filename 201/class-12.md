## Chart.js Article
Chart.js can be used to draw all kinds of colorful, animated charts  like line, bar, pie, and after downloading Chart.Js is seems pretty simple to add charts to your javascript.

## Canvas Articles
Canvas on first glance looks like an image tag without src or alt attributes, it's only attributes being width and height, 300 ppx by 150 px if left unspecified.  The canvas acts as a fixed drawing surface where you can put anything, such as images, or probably stuff like charts as well. Many shapes are loaded into canvas and can be drawn easily with commands l;ike fillRect(x,y,width, height) which draws a filled in rectangle. Styles and colors can also be applied to a canvas, and text can also be drawn on the screen as well.
