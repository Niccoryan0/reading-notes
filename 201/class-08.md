# Day 08 Readings
*Readings for day 8 of class*

## HTML&CSS book:
### Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)
There are various positioning schemes CSS can use to lay out the page:
- Normal: Block levels get new line
- Relative: Shifts the element in some direction
- Absolute: Gives element an absolute position on the page and allows overlap with other items.
- Fixed: Special kind of absolute positioning relative to the page iteself
- Floating: Basically absolute but maintains collision with other objects.

*Screen Layouts:* Liquid layouts change along with the screen, reformatting the layout of boxes and other items to fit viewing device's screen. Fixed width layouts don't change the layout of the page with sizing changes, they just scale elements up or down to match the page size.
