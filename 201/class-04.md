# Class 04 Readings
*Readings for Day 4 of CF 201*

## HTML&CSS
### Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
*Basics:* Links can be embedded into HTML using a tags, within which the link's destination is is assigned to the href attribute. Links can go to other sites if you supply the absolute URL, other pages within the current site using an absolute or a relative URL. Setting target attribute to "_blank" will open the link in a new window. Email links can be inserted using mailto:emailaddress.org for the href. Lastly links can specify where in page to link to, in itself or another page, using #location for the href either alone, within the same page, or after another URL, within a different page.

### Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
*Basics:* Boxes that hold other boxes in HTML are called containing or parent elements.

*Positioning Schemes:*
- Normal: Every block-level element appear on new line
- Relative: Shifts the element TRBL of where it would normally be
- Absolute: Takes an image out of the "normal flow", meaning other things can overlap with it (later code appears above earlier code in document), and gives it an absolute position in relation to the containing element
- Fixed: Form of absolute that fixes image in relation to the browser window rather than it's containing element
- Floating: Take's element out of normal flow but keeps it "collision" with other elements, so they will be positioned around it

*Screen Layouts:* Given the range of devices people use now, many different sized screen have to be accomodated for. Web designers usually try to create pages that are 960-1000 pixels wide as that can be viewed on most devices, but height is more variable. However, some prefer to use **liquid layouts** which can change if the screen is adjusted as opposed to **fixed width** layouts which can't.
## JS&JQuery
### Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)
*Basics:* Creating a function requires the function keyword, a name and possibly parameters for the function, and runs whatever is in it's code block when called. A value can be retrieved from a function using return, or multiple values in an array.

### Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”
*Basics:* Having two programmers working together, one acting as the Driver, managing the "mechanics" of the code i.e. being the one on the computer acting and typing, and the Navigator who watches and thinks about the big picture and other more abstract questions.

*Why do it?:* It helps to build the very important skills necessary to learning a new language of any kind, listening, spekaing, reading and writing. Research has also shown that while it takes slightly longer to have two people work together like this, the code is higher-quality and requires less effort later fixing it. It allows programmers to engage and focus more, learn to ask for and receive help, and observe different approaches to problem-solving. It also helps to prepare for job interviews and the work environment, because many corporations use it in practice and in interviews.
