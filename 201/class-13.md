## Article
The earliest example of local storage on a website that the article discusses is Microsoft releasing Internet Explorer with the ability to store userData, up to 64 kb for regular websites or up to 640 for trusted domains. In 2007, Google came out with Gears, which included an API for adding an SQL database to a page, greatly expanding storage capacity on a local site. The next big leap was HTML5 Storage, otherwise known as local storage or DOM storage, which stores key-value pairs at the client-level of a website and, like cookies, cna persist after leaving a site. Like other key-value pairs, the data stored can be accessed using it's key, using commands such as getItem(key); or removeItem() and several others. While being immensely useful, there are a few limitations to HTML 5 storage, these include only have 5mb of storage (for each origin), with the QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR being thrown when that is exceeded, and at the time this article was written there was no way to request more. Some browsers allow the user to choose to store more than 5mb but that is solely on the user side, devs can't do anything to get more.
