## HTML & CSS:
### Introduction (pp.2-11)
**Overview:**

*Web basics:* The content and general appearance of any website are primarily created using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). These work in tandem to create the front face of any website.  To connect to the internet we go through ISPs (Internet Service Providers), who take a domain that we are attempting to reach and connect us to a Domain Name System, or a network of different servers, to locate the domain's IP address and request the page being searched which is then sent back to your computer.

**Definitions:**

HTML
: Creates the content of the site such as words, images, tables, and more. Can be thought of as the Builder of a website.

CSS
: Gives the website it's presentation and layout, things like font styles and positions of different elements on the screen. Gives pretty much any and all style to plain old HTML, can be thought of as the Artist of a website.

DNS
: Domain Name System's act like directories full of IP addresses, connecting us to whichever we need to access a certain domain.
