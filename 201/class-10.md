## JS/JQuery Book:
### Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”
Execution context refers to the idea that in the JS interpreter there is one global context, which is any code written outside a function, which would only be run once, and function context, code that is being run within a function and can be repeated as many times as wished, these correspond to the ideas of global and local-level scope. The stack refers to the fact that the JavaScript interpreter process code one line at a time and if it hits a line that requires another functions data it will stack, or pile up, the new function on top of the current task, execute that first, and return to the original line. Debugging refers to the process of finding and correcting errors in your code. The console helps us do this by indicating which area the error is located in, and can tell us what type of error it is. JavaScript has 7 different error types: EvalError, InternalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError and URIError, which are all thrown for different reasons. If you expect an error in your code, using states like try, catch and finally can help handle it better, and can also give users helpful feedback.
