*Readings for day 11 of class*

## HTML & CSS
### Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)
Some things CSS can do with images: resize them, align them on the page, use them as background images for certain boxes, repeat them across the screen horizontally or vertically, move the background location of an image for a moving background, create image sprites so the browser doesn't have to load as much.

### Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)
Analytics tools are increidbly useful for viewing how many people visit your site, how they found it (where they came from), and what they want to do on the website. Domain names are what give a website it's unique identity, and these need to be hosted on a web server. FTP (File Transer Protocol) prograns allow you to transer files directly from your local machine to the web server you're using. Lots of companies provide platforms or templates for things like blogigng, emailing newsletters and e-comerce so that they don't have to be written from scratch.

## Article
The video and audio tags in HTML can used to upload content of those types to a page. This content can be modified in several ways, such as by showing or hiding controls (pause, play, etc.), or with the HTMLMediaElement API. Most of the styling for them is actually very similar to an image or other kind of box content in HTML, with additional options related to the controls.
