*Day 1 readings*

## HTML & CSS:
### Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)
Structural markup
: Used to describe headings and paragraphs, including the heading and paragraph tags themselves but also things like bold, italic, superscript, subscript, white space, line breaks and horizontal rules (lines).

Semantic markup
: Used to provide extra information, including emphasis (shown using italics by default), strong (shown using bold by default), quotations, abbreviations, citations, definitions, authors details, and changes to content.

### Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)
Selector
: Indicates which element the rule will apply to, such as p for all paragraph elements, multiple names can be applied to one set of styling rules by seperating them with commas.

Declaration
: Indicates how the elements in the selector will be styled, split into a property and a value seperated by a comma such as: background-color : blue

## JS & JQuery:
### Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)
Variable
: Stored data in a piece of code, such as: x = 4, x being the variable obviously. Can be several different things such as numbers, strings, and booleans. 

Array
: Special variable that can hold multiple pieces of information. Information in an array can be indexed, accessed and changed in various ways.

### Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
Conditional Statements
: Will check whether a given script passed into it meets a predefined criteria, and acts based on whether or not it does. One such statement is an if or an if...else statement, which will run a piece of code only if whatever is passed into it evaluates true, else (otherwise) it does something else. Uses operators like == for is equal to, != for not equal to, >= for greater than or equal to, etc.

Logical Operators
: Comparison operators usually return a single value i.e. true or false, so we sometimes need to chain them together to check multiple in one go such as: ((6 > 3) && (1+2 == 3)), which would return true. These inclue the and operator, the or operator, and the not operator.
