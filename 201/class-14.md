## CSS Transforms
Transform controls in CSS contain the following options: scale, rotate, translate, skew, and these can be combined to achieve many more effects. Additionally, transforms can take in an origin which tells the center of an object for transforming purposes. 

## CSS Transitions and Animations
Transitions in CSS3 are a new feature that allows one to alter the appearance or behavior of an element when a state change occurs such as hovering. These can be given durations,timings, delays, and many other features and effects to make good transitions. Keyframes are used to animate content in CSS, they generally define how an image will move across the screen if you are attempting to animate it (this is how I achieved the moving background for the About Me). These transitions and animations are hugely customizable and can be used to really flesh out a website. 

## Google Article
The article is about what makes good group dyanmics, how groups differ, and how one might be able to work in groups more effectively. It discusses the fact that researchers found a few qualities from groups who put out quality work in a study finding the good groups all talked about an equal amount, they also were generally skilled at intuiting the thoughts and feelings of those around them, making them more sympathetic to their group mates, the article then makes the conclusion that if given the choice between a serious-minded team and a more free-flowing cooperative group the latter is a better choice.
