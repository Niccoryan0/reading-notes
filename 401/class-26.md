- BootStrap (Currently 4th edition) is a responsive framework based on a grid system, and contains pre built components for the developer to use on their website to cut down on the amount of time spent on CSS.

- In the new 4th edition BootStrap is considered an actual framework, and can be customized and changed in many ways.
