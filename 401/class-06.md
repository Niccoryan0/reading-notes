## Review
### Review your readings from earlier this week. Share with me one thing that you understand better today, than you did when originally introduced.
I understand much better now how memory allocation works not only in C# but more generally in computers. Coming from Python and JavaScript I had never really thought about how much space was taken up by things like arrays and objects, or the concept of initializing arrays with a set length. It was interesting to read about Linked Lists because I had never considered that memory could be conceptualized spatially, and that arrays were iterable with for loops because the data is essentially being lumped together in storage, like that seems intuitive but I had never really thought about how that actually works. This and the Big O readings also helped to understand Big O for space efficiency a bit better, which I've struggled with before.
