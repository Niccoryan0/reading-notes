- In EF Core data access is performed via a model which is made up of entity classes and a context object representing the database session.
- Models can be generated from existing database, hard code a model or use EF Migrations to create a database and evolve it overtime as the model changes.
- Instances of the entity class are used to create, delete and modify data.

- Data Seeding
[Link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/data-seeding)
- Data seeding is the act of populating a database with initial data. There are three main ways to accomplish this in EF Core: model seed data, manual migration customization and custom initialization logic.
- Model Seed Data: In EF Core 2.1 the EF Core migrations can automatically compute what operations should be applied when upgrading a database to a new model. Some restrictions of this include that the primary key must be specified even if usually it's generated by the database, and previously seeded data will be removed if the PK is changed at all. This makes it most useful for static data.
- Manual Migration Customization: "When a migration is added the changes to the data specified with HasData are transformed to calls to InsertData(), UpdateData(), and DeleteData(). One way of working around some of the limitations of HasData is to manually add these calls or custom operations to the migration instead."
- Custom Initialization Logic: "A straightforward and powerful way to perform data seeding is to use DbContext.SaveChanges() before the main application logic begins execution."
